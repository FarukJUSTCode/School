          <p>The Parents and Citizens Association (P & C) is a collection of parents, caregivers, school staff and other citizens who wish to promote the education of students at MacGregor State High School.</p>
          <p class="mb-0">The scheduled meetings are held in the school's Learning Hub (Library) and commence at 7:30pm. Dates set for 2018 are:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>14th February</li>
            <li>14th March (Annual General Meeting)</li>

            <li>17th October</li>
            <li>28th November</li>
          </ul>

          <p>If you are interested in attending, please call our P&C Administrator, Suzette Moore on 3347 3512 or smoor174@eq.edu.au to address any questions or to locate the venue.</p>
          <p>Parents and caregivers often think they cannot contribute to their children’s Secondary education.  Nothing could be further from the truth as students often do their best when there is a partnership between the student, school and home.</p>
          <p>A way of getting involved is through attending P & C meetings or by volunteering in the Canteen.  Either way you can provide a tangible benefit to the school.</p>
          <p>It is essential to have a functioning P & C presence within any school and while MacGregor is a large school, only a handful of parents keep the Association running.</p>
          <p>You only need to commit to a few hours a month to attend meetings and this provides you with the opportunity to voice your views and opinions in a relaxed environment with other parents.  I urge anyone interested to attend one of the scheduled meetings to see how the P & C operates.</p>
          <p>If this is not your preference, then volunteering in the Canteen also contributes to the school.  The activities of the Canteen and Uniform Shop are the sole source of funds which the P & C uses to benefit the school.  Please contact our Business Administrator on 3347 3512 to discuss helping out for a few hours, even if it can only be once a term.  In exchange, the P & C provides you with a “Thank you” voucher for your child to redeem at the Canteen.</p>
